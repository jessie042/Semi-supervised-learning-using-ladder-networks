# semi-supervised-learning
In this repo, we analyzed how semi-supervised learning improves the prediction accuracy on MNIST dataset. 
1. We fixed the number of labeled images (1000 images) and changed the number of unlabeled images to see how the the test accuracy changes. 
2. We also study the Gaussian noise in the Ladder Network model by changing the standard deviation of the noise and by changing the amount of unlabeled data.
